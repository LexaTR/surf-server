	//Special Loading Definition
	//- This entry is used whenever a client's data has not loaded from the server.
	//- Do not change the "Loading" entry, or delete it, as it'll break things. If you do not want

	//Rank Position Definition
	//- These entries obey the ConVar timer_ranks_position_method, determining whether the "ranks"
	//    or "points" value is the one used.
	//
	//- The "chat" and "text" keys support using Colors (either colors.inc or morecolors.inc)
	//  - Limit colors to 2 to 3 colors per entry; using more is not recommended.
	//  - Supports custom values, such as #FFFFFF for WHITE
	//  - Also supports using {color} tags, depending on which configuration is used.
	//    - CS:GO == colors.inc
	//    - CS:S == morecolors.inc
	//
	//- Functionality for timer_ranks_position_method
	//  - Method: Points (timer_ranks_position_method 0)
	//    - Compares client's total number of points against the "points" value for each definition.
	//    - If a client has 50 points, and definitions are 10, 30, and 80, the client will use the 
	//        definition for 30 points, as > 30 but < 80.
	//  - Method: Ranks (timer_ranks_position_method 1)
	//    - Grabs the client's current rank within the server and determines what defintion to use.
	//    - The "ranks" value for each definition is the highest rank to consider anyone for.
	//    - If there are ranks 3 10 and 50, ranks 1-3 use the first definition, 4-10 use the second,
	//		  and anyone 11-50 will use the third definition. If no other definitions are defined,
	//        all other players are considered out of rankings and receive no tag.
	//
	//- Special Out-Of-Ranking Positions
	//  - If a definition is declare with a "points" value of "-1" or a "ranks" value of "-1" (depending
	//      what timer_ranks_position_method is set to), any player that falls outside the defined rankings
	//      will receive that special position.
	//  - These entries will not appear within the View Rank Positions command.
